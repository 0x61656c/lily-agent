# Lily AI Email Agent - How It Works

## Overview

Lily is an AI-powered front-end engineer that works through email communication. Users can add Lily to their development team by simply sending an email to `lily@designer.universalinterfaces.com`.

## How the Email Agent Works

### 1. **Email-Based Interface**
- Users initiate contact by sending an email to Lily's dedicated email address
- No sign-up, API keys, or complex integrations required
- Works with any email client

- Lily understands project requirements written in plain English
- Interprets technical specifications, design requests, and feature descriptions
- No need for specific commands or syntax

### 3. **AI-Powered Development**
- Processes requests using advanced AI models trained on front-end development
- Generates production-ready code following industry best practices
- Supports modern frameworks, libraries, and tools

### 4. **Workflow**

```
User Email → Lily Processes Request → Code Generation → Response with Implementation
```

1. **Request**: User sends an email describing what they need built
2. **Processing**: Lily analyzes the requirements and context
3. **Development**: AI generates the appropriate code/solution
4. **Delivery**: Lily responds with the implementation via email
